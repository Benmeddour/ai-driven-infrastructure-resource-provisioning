# Virtualization Infrastructure Concepts

## Cluster Management

- **Cluster** - Group of physical hosts managed as a single resource pool
- **DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler)** - Automated resource balancing across cluster nodes
- **HA (High Availability)** - Automatic VM restart on host failure
- **Affinity Rules** - Policies controlling VM-to-host placement and VM-to-VM relationships
- **Live Migration** - Moving running VMs between hosts without downtime

## Storage Technologies

- **VMDK** - Virtual Machine Disk format for storing VM data
- **Datastore** - Storage container for virtual machine files and templates
- **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)** - Linux storage virtualization and management
- **Ceph** - Distributed storage system for scalability and redundancy
- **Snapshot** - Point-in-time copy of VM state for backup and recovery

## Network Infrastructure

- **OVS (Open vSwitch)** - Software-defined networking for virtual environments
- **Load Balancer** - Distributes network traffic across multiple servers
- **pfSense / OPNsense** - Open-source firewall and routing platforms

## Resource Allocation

- **Virtual CPU Allocation** - Assigning CPU cores/threads to virtual machines
