                        <li>Install Proxmox VE: Install Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) on your physical server(s).</li>
                        <li>Network Configuration: Configure the networking setup for Proxmox (bridged, NAT, or VLAN-based) to ensure proper communication between VMs, containers, and external networks.</li>
                        <li>Storage Configuration: Set up local storage or integrate network-attached storage (NAS) or software-defined storage (Ceph) to handle VM/container disk storage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proxmox Cluster Setup (if applicable)</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a Proxmox Cluster: If you plan to scale, create a cluster by joining multiple Proxmox nodes. This allows for high availability, live migration of VMs, and centralized management.</li>
                        <li>Configure Cluster Network: Set up the private network used for communication between cluster nodes to ensure proper synchronization and migration.</li>
                        <li>HA (High Availability) Setup: Configure HA groups and resources to ensure that VMs are automatically migrated in case of node failure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>VM and Container Template Management</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create Base Templates for VM and Containers: Use templates for VM and container provisioning to speed up the deployment of new environments.</li>
                        <li>Create minimal base images for both virtual machines and containers with pre-configured operating systems.</li>
                        <li>Template Versioning and Storage: Manage and store templates efficiently so that updates can be easily tracked and deployed. This can be integrated into your configuration management repository.</li>
                        <li>Snapshot and Backup Strategy: Regularly take snapshots of VMs and containers for backup and restore purposes. This is essential for ensuring data integrity and quick rollback.</li>

                        <li>Set up network interfaces with automatic IP allocation or DHCP if necessary.</li>
                        <li>Storage Management: Automate the provisioning of storage for VMs and containers using Proxmox's ZFS, LVM, or Ceph for storage management.</li>
                        <li>Use storage pools to define storage allocation for different types of VMs (e.g., high-performance storage for databases, lower-tier storage for web servers).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>VM and Container Configuration Management</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automate Post-Deployment Configuration: Use configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet to automate the configuration of VMs/containers after they have been provisioned.</li>
                        <li>Example: Installing required packages, setting up firewall rules, configuring application services, etc.</li>
                        <li>Security Hardening: Automate the application of security patches and configurations to ensure that each VM/container meets the organization’s security standards.</li>
