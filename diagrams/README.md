# Diagrams Folder

This folder contains all architectural and workflow diagrams for the **PFE2025-RSD** Master's Thesis project.

## 📂 Folder Structure

### Main Project Diagrams

- **`Main_diagrams.drawio`** - **Master thesis diagrams** ⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT**  
  Contains all the primary diagrams used throughout the project, including system architecture, workflow diagrams, and conceptual models that illustrate the core components of the thesis work.  
  **Note**: This file is restricted and should not be modified. If you need to create new diagrams, please add a new file instead.

### Templates

The following files are **reusable templates** that can be helpful for creating new diagrams or extending the project:

- **`template_agent_pipline.drawio`** - Template for agent pipeline workflows  
  A reusable template for designing AI agent pipelines and CrewAI-based workflows, showing the flow between user interaction, agent processing, and tool execution.

- **`data_center_template.drawio`** - Template for data center infrastructure  
  A template for designing data center architectures with redundancy, scalability, and security components.

- **`data_center_flow_diagram.drawio`** - Data center workflow example  
  An example diagram showing data flow in a data center environment with high availability, load balancing, and disaster recovery considerations.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. **Viewing diagrams**: Open `.drawio` files using [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) (formerly draw.io)
2. **Editing templates**: You can edit template files directly in the web app or use the desktop version
3. **Creating new diagrams**: Use the template files as starting points for new architecture or workflow diagrams
4. **⚠️ Important**: Do **NOT** edit `Main_diagrams.drawio` - this file is restricted. If you need to modify diagrams, create a new file, copy all the content from `Main_diagrams.drawio`, and edit it as needed
